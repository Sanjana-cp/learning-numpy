# Student Analytics (Learning Project)

This repository is part of my learning journey with Python and NumPy.

## basics
This folder contains simple programs where I practice working with
student marks, averages, grades, and rankings using basic NumPy and logic.

## zscore
This folder contains my main work.
Here I am learning how to use normalization and Z-score to analyze
student performance in a more machine-learning style way.

I will keep adding and improving files in this folder as I learn more.

## Tools
Python
NumPy
